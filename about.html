                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Behind the computer, I'm a GIS Analyst with a developer focus. 
					</p>
					<p>
						I currently work for the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency building digital mapping applications and data services. I'm also pursuing a <a href = "https://geography.wisc.edu/gis/onlinemasters/">Master of Science</a> in <i>Cartography, GIS, and Web Map Programming</i> from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
					</p>
					<p>
						Away from the computer, I enjoy exploring the outdoors (skiing, hiking, kayaking, mountain biking), traveling, and hanging out with my wife and dog.
					</p>
					<p>
                        I'm a native Wisconsinite, raised in <a href="https://earth.google.com/web/@43.177945,-90.06681155,223.25934402a,8476.23494833d,35y,0h,45t,0r/data=ChMaEQoJL20vMDFtbjYzGAIgASgCKAI">Spring Green, WI</a>, but now call <a href = "https://earth.google.com/web/@38.9227306,-119.97851455,1912.9398144a,18086.03558246d,35y,0h,0t,0r/data=ChIaEAoIL20vMHRfMmcYAiABKAI">South Lake Tahoe, CA</a> home.

						<i class="fas fa-history"></i> <b> BACKGROUND: </b> 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I discovered "GIS" during my sophomore year at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee</a> while visiting the <a href="https://uwm.edu/libraries/agsl/agsldata/">American Geographical Society Library</a>. There, I secured a position filing maps away, re-shelving old National Geographic’s, and cataloging geospatial data. From that point on I was hooked. I knew I had found my life's work, so I took every GIS class that UWM had to offer, both in the Geography and Urban Planning Departments, and spent an inordinate amount of time tinkering in ArcMap.
					</p>
					<p>
                        In the summer of 2007, I landed an internship with the <a href="https://www.newberlin.org/100/GIS-LIS-Mapping">City of New Berlin</a>, that allowed me to apply my newly acquired GIS knowledge. It was an amazing experience working on projects across the Public Works, Engineering and the Community Development departments. I was exposed to countless GIS projects, and the internship evolved into a year-round-full time GIS Specialist job after I finished my <a href= "https://uwm.edu/geography/undergraduate/major/geographical-information-track/">Bachelor's degree</a>. During my time there, I was able to digitize the entire backlog of easements, GPS, attribute, and map the entire storm sewer network, standardize the GIS process for updating zoning using coordinate geometry, and hyperlink all of the scanned as-built drawings to a spatial index.  
					</p>
					<p>
						I got an itch to travel and broaden my GIS experience, so I jumped at the chance to map black bear home ranges in <a href="https://www.nps.gov/seki/planyourvisit/human_bear_mgt.htm">Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks</a>. This experience provided my first real taste of the Sierra Nevada, and I couldn't get enough. I got to run around in the mountains tracking Bears with radio telemetry and then analyze their foraging habits by spatial interpolating temporal GPS location data and correlating that with vegetation data. In the years following I filled various roles in the National Park Service and United States Forest Service; applying my GIS skills to biological science, forestry, wildland fire, and engineering projects.
					</p>
                    <p>
						Eventually, I landed in Placerville, CA working for the <a href = "https://www.fs.usda.gov/main/eldorado/landmanagement/gis">El Dorado National Forest</a> as a GIS Specialist. I gained a deep understanding of how to integrate geospatial analysis and maps into the environmental review process (NEPA). I was the primary GIS professional on multiple interdisciplinary teams working on restoring forest health. I also got sent out as a GIS Specialist on active wildland fire and burned area emergency response teams, working long days to ensure the teams mapping and data collection needs are constantly met. The experience of working on an emergency response team really taught me how to be a GIS professional while under pressure to produce.
					</p>
                    <p>
						In October of 2016, I became the GIS Analyst for the <a href = "http://www.tahoeopendata.org/">Tahoe Regional Planning Agency</a>. I immediately began working on automating the update of the parcel data. I was able to accomplish scripting that workflow and many more. I spend the most of my time building web and mobile applications for staff. I love providing geospatial tools that make their job easier. In that regard, the past three years at TRPA have been amazing. I've grown my data science skills with Python, took on managing databases, projects, and staff, trained end users in GIS, built a network of Tahoe GIS professionals, and become highly skilled at developing web and mobile mapping applications. At TRPA, I've really turned the corner and become a seasoned GIS professional.
					</p>
                    <p>
                        I'm also nearing completion of that <a href="https://geography.wisc.edu/gis/onlinemasters/">Master's</a> I keep talking about. I've learned a tremendous amount through the course work. I've been able to put so many new tools in my "tool-belt". It's really helped me get to that next level, and become a GIS Developer.  The <i>Gecomputting in Python</i> course really deepened my understanding of Python and gave me the confidence that I could complete any GIS coding project. The <i>Graphic Design in Cartorgraphy</i> course dove deep into cartographic theory and strategy, while also challenging us to create professional products using Adobe Illustrator. The <i>Interactive Cartography and Visualization</i> course instilled the foundations of open source web mapping, using Leaflet and D3 JavaScript libraries. The <i>Spatial Databases</i> course was a nice refresher in SQL, and it introduced me to PostgreSQL/PostGIS, an open source enterprise geodatabase solution. The <i>Spatial Analysis</i> course has been very challenging, covering all aspects of spatial autocorrelation and interpolation, as well as their various implementations. I have one class to go (<i>Spatial Web and Mobile Programming</i>) before completing the <i>Practicum</i> and <i>Capstone</i> courses in the Spring of 2020. For my capstone project, I plan to build a web map application that allows the citizens of Lake Tahoe to better understand the development constraints and opportunities at the parcel scale.
